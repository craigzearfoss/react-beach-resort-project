# React Beach Resort Project

## Setup
- Bootstrap the project with create-react-app.
- Install additional dependencies.
```
create-react-app beach-resort project 
npm install react-icons --save
npm install react-router-dom --save
```
- react-router-dom Doesn't Play Well with Netlify.
- Put following file named *_redirects* into the */public* folder.
  - This allows the redirectign and routing in Netlify to work like it would locally for any React application.
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

## [react-router-dom](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start)
- Installation:
```
npm install react-router-dom --save
```
- \<Route path="..." ... /> will match the first path so add the exact attribute so it uses exact matching.
```
<Route exact path="..." ... />
```
- To set up a default page if none of the routes match us the \<Switch> element.
```
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
        <Route exact path="/rooms/" component={Rooms} />
        <Route exact path="/rooms/:slug" component={SingleRoom} />
        <Route component={Error} />
      </Switch>

```

## [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
- Rendered as svgs.
- Installation:
```
npm install react-icons --save
```
- Usage:
```
import { FaBeer } from "react-icons/fa";

class Quesion extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h3> Lets go for a <FaBeer />? </h3>
  }
}
```

## [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)
- Create a Context object.
```
const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue);
```
### Context.Provider
- Allow consuming components to subscribe to context changes.
- One Provider can be connected to many consumers.
- Providers can be nested to override values deeper within the tree.
```
<MyContext.Provider value={/* some value */}>
```

```
class MyClass extends React.Component {
  static contextType = MyContext;
  render() {
    let value = this.context;
    /* render something based on the value */
  }
}
```

```
<MyContent.Consumer>
  {value => /* render something based on the context value */}
</MyContent.Consumer>
```

### [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/docs)
- Allows you to attach styles to a component and they will be immediately rendered.
- The styles are written in JavaScript.
- Installation
```
npm install --save styled-components
```
